gpkg-core
==========

An experimental core geopackage specification derived from the geopackage candidate standard. 

To contribute find an issue in the [tracker] (http://github.com/rajrsingh/gpkg-core/issues) and make a pull request. 

If you are a github newbie then just hit 'edit' on the [spec.md page] (https://github.com/rajrsingh/gpkg-core/blob/master/spec.md). Then create a 'pull request' from your fork to submit the work for review and merging.

If you are comfortable with git then please fork the project and do individual tickets in their own branches.

For more on markdown there is a great [cheat sheet] (https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).
And note you can hit 'preview' at any time in edit mode to see if you got things right.
